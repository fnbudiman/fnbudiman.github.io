This is my website, which also hosts my blog. I use Jekyll's <a href="https://github.com/jekyll/minima" target="_blank">Minima</a>, but I take inspirations from some other themes and websites during the customization:

- pagination and font awesome activation are inspired by <a href="https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now/pull/1486" target="_blank">Evodify</a>
- archive pages are inspired by <a href="https://github.com/zivong/jekyll-theme-hamilton" target="_blank">Hamilton</a>
- post collection is inspired by <a href="https://github.com/alshedivat/al-folio" target="_blank">al-folio</a> and <a href="https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/" target="_blank">Academic Pages</a>
